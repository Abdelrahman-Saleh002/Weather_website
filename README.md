Weather_App

A weather website built with **JavaScript** uses client-side scripting to fetch and display real-time weather data from APIs like OpenWeatherMap. 
It allows users to search by city or use geolocation to show local conditions. JavaScript handles API requests, parses JSON responses, 
and dynamically updates the DOM to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts. The site can feature icons, weather alerts, and a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. 
Interactive elements like dropdowns or hourly forecast sliders enhance usability. This approach creates a fast, lightweight, and engaging weather platform without requiring complex backend systems.

- Built the app using vanilla JavaScript, handling API requests and dynamic DOM updates.
- Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather conditions and 5-day forecasts based on city name or user geolocation.
- Displayed weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons using responsive UI components.
